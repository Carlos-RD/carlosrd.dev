Consider this my way of staying connected with technology and attempting to create something different and new to me.\nHow did it all begin? It started with a desire to sharpen my Linux skills. So, like any self-respecting nerd, I did what needed to be done - I bought a second-hand Lenovo Thinkpad (mine\u0026rsquo;s a T480S) and installed Linux on it. Initially, I tried Fedora, which brought back memories of my academic years. However, after a brief wrestling match with the fingerprint sensor (about five minutes, to be precise), I decided to settle down with Pop!_OS. That, and the fact that I\u0026rsquo;m more comfortable with Debian-based distros (apt FTW!).\nWhat am I intending to do? Now that I have a Linux-running computer, what\u0026rsquo;s next? The logical step, it seems, is to create a personal blog where I can share my my projects and track my progress. So I started delving into the worlds of Digitalocean VPS, NGINX, Github, Markdown and Hugo. And if that weren\u0026rsquo;t enough, I\u0026rsquo;m daring to work exclusively using Vim because, well, I like to live dangerously and I might be a bit of a masochist.\nWhat have I learned so far? The journey began with spinning up a VPS on DigitalOcean, created a Hugo page and hosted it in NGINX. Everything seemed great: the page loaded, certificates ran smoothly, and the mail server was set up. Soon I came across the first ‚Äúlittle issue‚Äù - outbound emails wouldn‚Äôt be sent. A bit of digging revealed that DigitalOcean blocks SMTP to prevent spam .\nBecause of this and my affinity for not paying for things, I decided to ditch the email server and host the webpage on GitHub instead. Maybe not as sophisticated but it does the job for now.\nVim\u0026rsquo;s learning curve is steeper than I initially thought. Quickly I learned that, in order to succeed with this task, one needs to map the CapsLock key to Esc to prevent severe left-hand injuries.\nWhat are the next steps? Work on creating a streamlined system for post creation to minimize resistance, making me more consistent and, therefore, more productive. Continue tinkering with Hugo and Blowfish to make this site more aesthetically pleasing. My markdown and HTML skills could use some sprucing up. And as for Vim, I believe (or at least hope) that sticking with it will yield promising results in the future. For now, I‚Äôll play with VimGenius whenever I find a couple of minutes to spare. I have never setup Firebase. I guess the time to change that has come.

I'm a native of Spain, born and raised in a household where electronics were a constant presence. My father's electronic endeavors, fueled by an 80286 PC running MS-DOS 6.2 and Norton Explorer, were a significant part of my upbringing. I found myself helping my father create printed circuit boards and solder the components, even though I never quite delved into the fundamentals of electronics. The shoemaker's son always goes barefoot, I guess... Around 19 years ago, I made the decision to study telecommunications and networking. It marked the beginning of my professional journey. I started working at local ISPs, simultaneously pursuing my Cisco CCNA certificate. This opened doors to supporting WAN networks, which in turn led to years of intense battles with ATM, T1/T3, and metro Ethernet lines. A decade later, an opportunity presented itself, behold the network security field.\nDuring this phase, I returned to university to delve into information systems and management. Here, I absorbed the theories about how information systems align with business objectives and the intricacies of organizational management. However, my passion for the technical side of things (\u0026ldquo;getting them hands dirty\u0026rdquo;) never waned. This led me to pursue a master\u0026rsquo;s degree in computer science with a focus on cybersecurity.\nFast forward to today, and you\u0026rsquo;ll find me spending more time in meetings discussing spreadsheets and pie charts than navigating the CLI. This is precisely why this space was created: a humble attempt on my part to continue wrestling with technology, creating something new, and pulling out a few hairs in the process.\nProfessional Experience Company Website Location Position Dates SecureOps Montreal,\nCAN Manager of Infrastructure Support 2021 - Present Network Secrurity Team Lead 2018 - 2021 Prague,\nCZE Network Security Engineer 2018 - 2018 Symantec Prague,\nCZE Technical Support Engineer 2016 - 2017 AT\u0026T Brno,\nCZE Network Operations Team Leader 2013 - 2016 Network Specialist 2012 - 2013 Network Analyst 2010 - 2012 ","date":"30 August 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/about/","section":"Welcome to Carlos' Tech Corner! where the magic takes place. üéâ","summary":"About me Greetings!
